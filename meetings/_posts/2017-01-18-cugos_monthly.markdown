## Agenda

- CUGOS Board Update - newly minted officials will provide an update about their first board meeting of 2017!

- [@mapsam](https://github.com/mapsam) will walk us through the fix for [an issue on cugos.org](https://github.com/cugos/cugos.github.com/issues/176), which broke our Google Feed. This could turn into either an introduction on building a JSON API with Heroku, or how we use Jekyll/GitHub to host cugos.org - up to you! Choose your own adventure style.

- You! Interested in helping with the website, elections, future event planning? Add yourself to [this meeting page on github](https://github.com/cugos/cugos.github.com/blob/master/meetings/_posts/2017-01-18-cugos_monthly.markdown) or hit us up at <hello@cugos.org>.
